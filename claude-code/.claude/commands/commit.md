# Commit Changes

Review staged changes and create a commit with a clear, conventional commit message.

1. Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
2. If nothing is staged, run `git status` and suggest what to stage
3. Write a commit message following conventional commits format:
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation
   - refactor: code restructuring
   - test: adding tests
   - chore: maintenance
4. Create the commit
